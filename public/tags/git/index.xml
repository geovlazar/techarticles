      <description>Suppose we have a project named &amp;lsquo;flower&amp;rsquo; with different people working on it. Suppose some other team already created a repository named &amp;lsquo;Rose&amp;rsquo; which can add as a sub directory under our existing &amp;lsquo;flower&amp;rsquo; repository.

Newer versions of Git will do this automatically, but older versions will require you to explicitly tell Git to download the contents of rose:</description>
