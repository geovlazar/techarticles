    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation) is an EU regulation that intends to provide protection to personal data of the EU citizens and increase the constraints on organizations who handle these personal data. GDPR law applies to all companies that collect and process data belonging to EU citizens. Its major concern is data protection for individuals within the European Union and manages the export of personal data outside the EU. The primary objective of GDPR is to give citizens back control of their personal data. It will come into action on 25th May 2018.</p>
<p>There are two major parts of the Regulation that are to be highlighted</p>
<ul>
<li>The GDPR will be applicable to all companies that control or process data of EU citizens even if they are based outside of the EU.</li>
<li>The penalties for not following the terms and conditions of the Regulation are going to be severe. Based on the type and severity of the violation, organizations will be liable to pay fines of up to €20 million or 4% of their global annual revenue which is something they cannot</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process for GDPR Compliance</strong></p>
<p>To comply with GDPR, organizations need to follow the steps mentioned below</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the law– have an idea of the obligations under GDPR as it corresponds to collecting, processing and storing data.</li>
<li>Create a road map– perform data discovery and document every research, findings, decisions and actions.</li>
<li>Know which data is regulated– categorize the data based on whether it falls under any GDPR special category, who has access to different types of data, who can share the data, and what applications can process the data.</li>
<li>Begin with critical data and procedures– assess the risk to all private data and ensure that proper security measures have been assigned.</li>
<li>Assess and document other risks– look for any other risks that may have been left out during previous assessment.</li>
<li>Revise and repeat– repeat the core steps (4 to 6) and make the necessary alterations wherever required.</li>
</ol>
