CKAN is a self-described data portal platform that allows an organization to manage, publish, and share data and for others to find and use that data. It is a tool for making open data websites.It helps you manage and publish collections of data. It is used by national and local governments, research institutions, and other organizations who collect a lot of data.</p>
<p>Once your data is published, users can use its faceted search features to browse and find the data they need, and preview it using maps, graphs and tables - whether they are developers, journalists, researchers, NGOs, citizens, or even your own staff.
In general, data portal platforms provide a structured solution of software, policies, and guidelines that let an organization (often a government entity) share data. The services embedded in these platforms may include data management, content management, data publishing, data discovery, visualization, and workflow. Other examples of such products include</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://socrata.com/">Socrata</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.junar.com/">Junar</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/dkan">DKAN</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opengovplatform.org/">Open Government Platform</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>CKAN installation guidelines are detailed on the site at <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/installing/index.html">Here</a></p>
<p>We can run it standalone (as noted above) or in a hosted instance. CKAN provides a hosted service, which lets you essentially run the software in an instance on their servers</p>
<h3 id="datasets-and-resources">DataSets and Resources</h3>
<p>For CKAN purposes, data is published in units called “datasets”. A dataset is a parcel of data - for example, it could be the crime statistics for a region, the spending figures for a government department, or temperature readings from various weather stations. When users search for data, the search results they see will be individual datasets.</p>
<p>A dataset contains two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information or “metadata” about the data. For example, the title and publisher, date, what formats it is available in, what license it is released under, etc.</li>
<li>A number of “resources”, which hold the data itself. CKAN does not mind what format the data is in. A resource can be a CSV or Excel spreadsheet, XML file, PDF document, image file, linked data in RDF format, etc. CKAN can store the resource internally, or store it simply as a link, the resource itself being elsewhere on the web. A dataset can contain any number of resources. For example, different resources might contain the data for different years, or they might contain the same data in different formats.</li>
