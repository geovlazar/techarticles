      <description>CKAN stands for Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network. CKAN is a self-described data portal platform that allows an organization to manage, publish, and share data and for others to find and use that data. It is a tool for making open data websites.It helps you manage and publish collections of data. It is used by national and local governments, research institutions, and other organizations who collect a lot of data.
Once your data is published, users can use its faceted search features to browse and find the data they need, and preview it using maps, graphs and tables - whether they are developers, journalists, researchers, NGOs, citizens, or even your own staff.</description>

      <description>Suppose we have a project named &amp;lsquo;flower&amp;rsquo; with different people working on it. Suppose some other team already created a repository named &amp;lsquo;Rose&amp;rsquo; which can add as a sub directory under our existing &amp;lsquo;flower&amp;rsquo; repository.
git submodule add https://github.com/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;/rose rose At this point, you’ll have a rose folder inside flower, but if you were to check inside that folder, depending on your version of Git, you might see … nothing. Newer versions of Git will do this automatically, but older versions will require you to explicitly tell Git to download the contents of rose:</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;PostGraphile&amp;rdquo; is a instant, secure and fast GraphQL API for PostgresSQL. This builds and serves a client-facing GraphQL API by inspecting your existing database (tables, columns, relations, views, procedures and more). No GraphQL coding necessary to get the data from an existing Schema or Database.This works with Apollo, Relay Modern and most other GraphQL clients. Enforce user permissions at the data level using PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s well established, granular and trusted Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Row-Level Security (RLS) features.</description>

      <description>Consider a case that we need to add a drupal user when we create a content type and that specific drupal user has first name and last name and contact details from a node. Usual way to create a Drupal user is to use the method user_save as the following way. For sending message we can set default mail alert from &amp;ldquo;Configuration -&amp;gt; Account Settings -&amp;gt; Email Alerts Section &amp;quot; as explained below</description>
