    <p>GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation) is an EU regulation that intends to provide protection to personal data of the EU citizens and increase the constraints on organizations who handle these personal data. GDPR law applies to all companies that collect and process data belonging to EU citizens. Its major concern is data protection for individuals within the European Union and manages the export of personal data outside the EU. The primary objective of GDPR is to give citizens back control of their personal data. It will come into action on 25th May 2018.</p>

<p>There are two major parts of the Regulation that are to be highlighted</p>

<ul>
<li>The GDPR will be applicable to all companies that control or process data of EU citizens even if they are based outside of the EU.</li>
<li>The penalties for not following the terms and conditions of the Regulation are going to be severe. Based on the type and severity of the violation, organizations will be liable to pay fines of up to €20 million or 4% of their global annual revenue which is something they cannot</li>
</ul>
