GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation) is an EU regulation that intends to provide protection to personal data of the EU citizens and increase the constraints on organizations who handle these personal data. GDPR law applies to all companies that collect and process data belonging to EU citizens. Its major concern is data protection for individuals within the European Union and manages the export of personal data outside the EU. The primary objective of GDPR is to give citizens back control of their personal data. It will come into action on 25th May 2018.

3. Know which data is regulated– categorize the data based on whether it falls under any GDPR special category, who has access to different types of data, who can share the data, and what applications can process the data.
4. Begin with critical data and procedures– assess the risk to all private data and ensure that proper security measures have been assigned.
