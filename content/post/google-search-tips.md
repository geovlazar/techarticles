Internet is everything in these days. We can get any kind of information from the era of internet and Google. Most of us rely on Google for searching the data and finding details from Google. Normally we type what we required to to search in google home page and click on the links which we got from there.

By using some simple techniques we can refine the data that we are looking for. It helps us to reach out the exact data which we want to see about the search result 

## Quotation marks for Phrases


When we add quotes around a series of words, Google searches for Web pages that contain that exact phrase or sentence. Searching for an exact phrase saves time by helping you find the exact information that you're looking for.Search for whole sentences or phrases in Google by putting quotation marks around them.

Suppose we want to search with schools name we can use it like "Little Queen School" instead of little Queen School . Now google consider the entire phrase as whole in its search otherwise it search three different words seperately.

## Search from a specific website

Suppose we want to know the information from a specific website we can use the "site:<sitename> before the search string. For example if we want to search anything from the website medigy.com we can give search query like these site:medigy.com healthcare . This will result the results from the specified website only.

## Related Words Search 

Use the tilde operator ( ~ ) in Google to search for terms related to the specified term. For example, searching for "trumpet ~orchestra" also returns search results for "symphony," "big band" and "opera." Searching for these related terms saves time, as you don't have to search for each term separately.

## Remove / Exclude terms 

Add a "-" symbol before a search term to exclude it from Google's search results. If, for example, we are looking for an ice cream recipe, but you can't stand vanilla, type "ice cream -vanilla" -- without the quotes -- into Google.
