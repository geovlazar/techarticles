"PostGraphile" is a instant, secure and fast GraphQL API for PostgresSQL. This builds and serves a client-facing GraphQL API by inspecting your existing database (tables, columns, relations, views, procedures and more). No GraphQL coding necessary to get the data from an existing Schema or Database.This works with Apollo, Relay Modern and most other GraphQL clients. Enforce user permissions at the data level using PostgreSQL's well established, granular and trusted Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Row-Level Security (RLS) features.
PostGraphile (formerly PostGraphQL) builds a powerful, extensible and performant GraphQL API from a PostgreSQL schema in seconds; saving us weeks if not months of development time.By combining powerful features such as PostgreSQL's role-based grant system and row-level security policies with Graphile-Build's advanced GraphQL look-ahead and plugin expansion technologies, PostGraphile ensures your generated schema is secure, performant and extensible.
