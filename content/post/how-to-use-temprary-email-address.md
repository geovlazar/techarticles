All of the websites need to submit emails nowadays. But when ever we submit the email address to any website from the next day onwards we will start getting spam Mails from the registered application. Trying to solve this by two easy hacks

## Use Temporary emails

There are some websites which allow us to get temporary email address and its inbox for a short span of time. FOr registering and testing we can use the email address and its inbox to see the mails received 

For example Try these 

1. [Temp-email](https://temp-mail.org/)
2. [TempMail](https://tempmail.dev/en/Gmail)

## Use Gmails feature to add extra emails [Gmail Plus]

Suppose we  have an email address like myname@gmail.com. If we append a “plus” sign to our email username, Gmail will ignore anything written between the + and @ sign in the email address and still deliver the message to the same inbox.

So any email address sent to myname+microsoft@gmail.com or myname+blog@gmail.com or myname+website@gmail.com will still reach the Gmail inbox of myname@gmail.com inbox though, technically, they are three different email aliases.

Thus, when you share your email with some non familiar service, like a newsletter, you can supply your existing email with a plus sign - like myname+websitename@gmail.com. If you ever receive spam addressed to that email alias, you know the exact source that’s sending the spam and can easily block all emails using a GMail filter.
